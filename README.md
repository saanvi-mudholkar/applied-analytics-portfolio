# Applied-Analytics-Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of academic projects in operations research, discrete-event simulation, forecasting and applied analytics, completed during my postgraduate studies. The projects showcase my experience using tools such as R, Excel Solver and Simul8 to model operational systems and support data-driven decision-making

## Operational Research
### Problem Overview
This project models a cost-minimisation distribution problem for a frozen food company operating two processing plants and multiple distribution warehouses. 
The objective is to determine the optimal shipment quantities that satisfy warehouse demand at minimum transportation cost, subject to capacity, routing, and operational constraints.
### Problem Approach
The problem is formulated as a linear optimization model and solved using Excel Solver.
Decision variables represent the number of cases shipped from each plant to each warehouse.
The objective function minimises total transportation cost while satisfying supply, demand, capacity, and routing constraints.
### Tools Used

## Forecasting
### Problem Overview
This project analyses patterns in a real-world time series and develops multiple forecasting models to predict future values. Using daily cash withdrawal transaction data from ATMs across the Northwest region, the models are evaluated and compared using accuracy metrics to identify the best-fitting approach. The selected model is justified based on its predictive performance and ability to capture underlying trends and seasonality in the data.
### Problem Approach
The project was completed in two stages. The group component focused on exploratory time series analysis, data preprocessing, and statistical diagnostics to understand underlying patterns. The individual component involved building and evaluating forecasting models using exponential smoothing, ARIMA, regression, and machine learning approaches, with model selection based on comparison against baseline methods and out-of-sample sMAPE performance.

## Simulation
### Problem Overview
This project uses stochastic modelling and simulation to analyse operational performance and support decision-making in three service systems: a call centre, a removal firm, and a fast food restaurant. The models evaluate capacity, staffing, and policy decisions under uncertainty, using performance measures such as waiting times, service levels, throughput, and profitability. Simulation and analytical methods are applied to explore alternative scenarios and provide operational recommendations based on model insights.
### Problem Approach
The project followed a structured stochastic modelling approach, combining analytical queueing models, Markov chains, and discrete-event simulation to evaluate service system performance under uncertainty. Model parameters were estimated from data, assumptions were justified, and multiple scenarios were analysed by varying capacity, staffing, and operational policies. Simulation experiments and optimisation techniques were used to compare alternatives and derive recommendations based on key performance metrics.
### Tools Used
